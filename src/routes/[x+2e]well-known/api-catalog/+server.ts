/**
 * GET /.well-known/api-catalog — RFC 9727 catalog of this deployment's APIs.
 *
 * WHY THE `[x+2e]well-known` DIRECTORY NAME: `[x+2e]` is SvelteKit's hex escape
 * for `.`, so this directory serves `/.well-known/...`. A literally-named
 * `.well-known/` directory routes correctly too, but TypeScript's wildcard
 * includes skip dot-directories — the files would silently drop out of
 * `svelte-check` and `$lib` aliases would stop resolving. The escape keeps the
 * URL identical while leaving the code type-checked. Don't "fix" the name.
 *
 * Returns `application/linkset+json` (RFC 9264): a `linkset` array where each
 * member anchors one API and carries typed link relations describing it.
 *
 * HONESTY RULE (AGENTS.md §8): every anchor below is a real, reachable endpoint
 * in this codebase, and every access note matches the auth actually enforced in
 * the handler. A catalog that advertises endpoints which 404, or that describes
 * an authenticated API as public, is worse than no catalog — agents follow it
 * and fail in ways that look like site outages. When you add, remove, or change
 * the auth on an API, update this file in the same change.
 *
 * Most of this app's API surface requires a session cookie and is intentionally
 * NOT presented as agent-callable; the agent-facing story is public content over
 * HTML/Markdown (see /auth.md and the skills index).
