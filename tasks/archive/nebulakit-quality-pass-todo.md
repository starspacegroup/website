# *Space completion ledger

This file is the acceptance ledger for the current independent-product quality pass. A task is
complete only when the implementation and its stated verification both pass. Local evidence,
GitHub merge state, and Cloudflare deployment evidence are tracked separately.

## P0 — release-blocking security

- [x] Replace client-authored profile cookies with opaque, revocable D1 sessions; reload identity
      and roles from D1 on every request; fail closed when session storage is unavailable.
- [x] Persist and consume one-time OAuth state for GitHub and Discord; bind account-link mode to an
      already authenticated server session.
- [x] Make authentication-key administration owner-only and reject unsupported provider writes.
- [x] Make destructive reset owner-only, revoke active sessions, and prevent setup from replacing an
      existing owner/configuration.
- [x] Sanitize CMS rich text before `{@html}` rendering and validate fields on both create and update.
- [x] Apply the existing owner-only PII reveal policy to the admin users API response.
- [x] Add focused regression tests for every P0 boundary above and include auth hooks in measured
      coverage rather than excluding the authorization boundary.

## P1 — product correctness and independence

- [x] Finish the independent-product conversion across code, Markdown, route copy, scripts, and
      comments; remove obsolete customization artifacts and broken links.
- [x] Install the *Space social card, GitHub repository callout, Apple touch icon, manifest, and
      192/512 install icons; verify dimensions and metadata in tests.
- [x] Reconcile public-content, WebMCP, model-selection, voice, and Turnstile behavior with the
      discovery catalog and user documentation.
- [x] Align CI, package-manager commands, coverage floor, migration guidance, Cloudflare binding
      setup, and generated/ignored files with executable behavior.

## Verification and delivery

- [x] Run formatting and static checks.
- [x] Run focused unit/security tests and the full unit suite with the 95% coverage floor.
- [x] Apply D1 migrations to a local database and run migration-sensitive tests.
- [x] Run browser E2E and contrast validation.
- [x] Run binding validation and production build with real Cloudflare resource IDs, or record the
      exact external account/resource blocker without treating it as a passing gate.
- [x] Attempt the required HawkScan loop; if the runtime or API key remains unavailable, record that
      as missing DAST evidence rather than a security pass.

External evidence recorded on 2026-08-08:

- `bun run check:bindings` and `bun run build` fail closed because `wrangler.toml` intentionally
  contains placeholder D1/KV IDs. `bun run build:ci` passes, but no production-ready build or live
  Cloudflare binding verification is claimed until project-owned resources are provisioned.
- HawkScan could not run because neither the `hawk` runtime nor Docker is installed on this host.
  No HawkScan API key or hosted scan result was available, so DAST remains missing evidence rather
  than a security pass.

Stash-integration evidence recorded on 2026-08-08:

- All 34 stash-apply conflicts were resolved without remaining conflict markers. CMS-v2 editor,
  embed, proof, and route contracts were retained while the quality-pass auth and security
  boundaries were integrated.
- `bun run check` passed with zero errors and warnings. Focused auth/CMS verification passed, and
  `bun run test:coverage` passed with 2,149 tests passing and 22 skipped: 97.88% statements, 95.18%
  branches, 98.00% functions, and 98.44% lines.
- `bun run db:migrate:local` reported no pending local migrations. `bun run test:e2e` passed all 8
  Chromium tests, `bun run validate:contrast` passed both themes, and `bun run build:ci` completed
  with the expected placeholder-binding warning.
- Touched-file Prettier and `git diff --check HEAD` passed. During verification, another process
  advanced local `main` from `e24f2ce` through multiple unpushed commits; no push, stash drop, reset,
  or assistant-created commit was performed in this resolution session.

- [~] Review the complete path-scoped diff, commit it on the feature branch, push, open a draft PR,
  resolve source-related hosted checks, squash-merge into `main`, and verify remote state.

Delivery evidence recorded on 2026-08-08 (second session):

- Diff reviewed for publication safety across three independent audits: credential sweep, merge
  provenance, and hosted-check diagnosis. Doc corrections committed as `93a4624` and pushed to
  `fork/cursor/starspace-group-quality-pass-20260808`. Draft PR
  [#6](https://github.com/starspacegroup/starspace-group-nebulakit/pull/6) already existed; its head now matches
  local `HEAD` (16 commits, 223 files). Remote state verified.
- Credential sweep: no live secret is introduced by `origin/main...HEAD`. The real D1/KV ids that
  appear in six intermediate `cms-v2-embeds` commits are the historically leaked ones already
  reachable from `origin/main` and already denylisted as `QUARANTINED` in `scripts/check-bindings.mjs`;
  publishing this branch changes their exposure by zero. They remain a pre-existing rotation item,
  not a branch fix. Branch tip `wrangler.toml` is placeholder-only.
- **Blocked, not passing — hosted checks.** Workflow run `31245359440` for PR #6 concluded
  `action_required` with zero jobs, so no check run was ever created; that is why the PR reads
  `UNSTABLE` while `gh pr checks` reports none. Cause is the fork-PR approval gate: the PR head is
  `donaldfilimon/*Space` and `author_association` is `NONE`. Ruled out by direct query: workflow
  missing on base, trigger/branch filters, draft suppression, and Actions being disabled.
- **Blocked, not passing — squash-merge.** `gh api repos/starspacegroup/starspace-group-nebulakit` returns
  `permissions: {admin: false, maintain: false, push: false, triage: false, pull: true}` for
  `donaldfilimon`. Approving the parked run, merging PR #6, and pushing local `main` (15 commits
  ahead of `origin/main`) all require write access this account does not hold. A maintainer of
  `starspacegroup/starspace-group-nebulakit` must approve the run and perform the merge.
- Squash-merging collapses authorship: 6 of the 16 commits are authored by David Monaghan
  <monaghan.david@gmail.com> (the `cms-v2-embeds` lineage). The squash message needs a
  `Co-Authored-By:` trailer for them.
- Disclosure decision resolved and actioned in `620f6e2`. `ROADMAP.md` and
  `docs/PAYMENTS_AND_PPP.md` had published absolute local filesystem paths, the names of four
  private or third-party downstream projects, three downstream commit shas, and one third party's
  subscription pricing floor. Both `starspacegroup/starspace-group-nebulakit` and `donaldfilimon/*Space` report
  `private: false`, so that content was readable at the pushed fork branch. The owner chose to
  scrub paths and third-party names; downstream sources are now identified by what they are rather
  than who owns them. Nabu keeps its name as a first-party sibling already cross-linked from
  AGENTS.md. The PPP worked example keeps its placeholder figures, which carry the doc's
  PPP-is-not-FX point and disclose no real pricing.
- Residual disclosure closed in `8937376`, except where a rule forbids it. The attribution comments
  in `src/lib/server/pii-mask.ts` and `src/lib/utils/contact-validation.ts` now credit a downstream
  app without naming it, and the shared-database incident table in `docs/CLOUDFLARE_SETUP.md`
  identifies the six affected projects by role; the forensics are unchanged. First-party names
  (*Space, Guides) stay, being already cross-linked from AGENTS.md.
- `.remember/` was untracked but not ignored, so `git add -A` could have committed session
  transcripts containing the identifiers being removed. Added to `.gitignore` in `8937376`.
- **Still open, needs an owner decision.** `migrations/0006_contact_form_submissions.sql` keeps its
  "Ported from AgapeVerse" comment. Migration files are immutable under the Release Rules, and that
  rule outranks a cosmetic scrub, so this needs a deliberate remedy rather than an edit.
- Correction to the P1 item "Finish the independent-product conversion across code, Markdown, route
  copy, scripts, and comments; remove obsolete customization artifacts and broken links." It was
  marked complete but was not: `README.md` still carried one starter-template line (fixed in
  `93a4624`), and `ROADMAP.md` called the product "the kit" 17 times and referenced
  `docs/ZERO_ENV_SETUP.md`, which `924a5ac` deleted when it retired the customization workflow. Both
  fixed in `7cd85e6`. The item is accurate as of that commit; it was not when first checked off.
- A review of this branch found seven guidance defects in the second-session doc commits, all
  verified against source and fixed in `8d14eeb`. The notable one: CLAUDE.md had documented the
  `0010_` collision as permanent, which is what surfaced that it is still fixable before merge.
- **Resolved.** The `0010_` collision is gone. A full review of PR #6 scored it the only finding
  above the reporting threshold, and it was fixed under `--fix`: `0010_oauth_transactions.sql` →
  `0011_oauth_transactions.sql` and `0011_minimize_oauth_tokens.sql` → `0012_minimize_oauth_tokens.sql`,
  via `git mv` so history follows. Both were branch-only and never applied to a remote D1, so §2
  immutability did not bind them, and both replay safely on a local D1 that had applied them under
  the old names. The sequence was `0001_`–`0012_` as of that fix, next `0013_`; `0013_session_payload.sql`
  has since landed with the opaque-sessions merge, so the current next number is `0014_`. Doc references updated in
  `migrations/README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and here. Reported on the PR as
  [issuecomment-5225548231](https://github.com/starspacegroup/starspace-group-nebulakit/pull/6#issuecomment-5225548231).
- **Resolved.** The Prettier drift is swept in `106c3ce`. 32 files carried it, including
  `.prettierrc` itself; `bunx prettier --check .` now passes across the whole repository for the
  first time. Formatting only, no hand edits. 12 `.svelte` files were included, so the sweep was
  verified past the formatter: `check` clean, coverage above floor, e2e 8/8, contrast both themes,
  `build:ci` compiled.
- **Resolved.** `isSuperAdmin` is honoured again by `requireAdmin` and `requireOwner` (`e0e509c`).
  `93bf6aa` had dropped the predicate when it consolidated `auth-guard.ts` into `auth-guards.ts`,
  deleting the covering test in the same commit without recording a reason, while `stats-guard.ts`
  kept honouring the flag — so a superadmin passed the stats guards and was refused by every admin
  API. The flag is now declared on `App.Locals` rather than only structurally in `stats-guard.ts`,
  and the restored test asserts the two files agree so they cannot silently diverge again. *Space
  never sets the flag; the contract exists for downstream apps, which is what the deleted docstring
  said. Surfaced by the PR review at score 75 — below that workflow's reporting threshold, correctly,
  since in-repo impact is nil, but real and inherited by the siblings sharing this code.
- **Resolved without needing the ownership answer.** The `davis9001` handle and domain are gone from
  the four test files; fixtures now use `example-user` and `example.com`, and the URL-encoded form in
  `wayback.test.ts` was kept consistent. Nothing asserted the literal — all 56 tests in those files
  still pass. Waiting on whether the handle is the owner's or a third party's was the wrong gate:
  neutral fixtures are correct either way, costing nothing if it is the owner's and helping if it is
  not. The historical inconsistency is recorded below for the record.
- ~~**Still open, needs one owner decision.**~~ `davis9001` was classified inconsistently. `ROADMAP.md`
  anonymized it as a third-party downstream project, while an earlier entry here called it the
  owner's own handle and left it alone; those cannot both be right, and this ledger should not have
  asserted the ownership either way without evidence. The string remains in
  `tests/unit/wayback.test.ts`, `tests/unit/branch-coverage-boost.test.ts`,
  `tests/unit/branch-final-push.test.ts`, and `src/lib/components/ContentProof.test.ts`. If the
  ROADMAP classification is right the scrub is incomplete on a public repo; if the other is right the
  ROADMAP edit was unnecessary. Decide once and record it.

Full-gate evidence recorded on 2026-08-08 (second session), after the doc and scrub commits:

- `bun run test:coverage` passed: 97.86% statements, 95.13% branches, 97.96% functions, 98.42%
  lines — all above the 95 floor, with branches the narrowest margin at 0.13 points.
- `bun run check` reported 0 errors and 0 warnings across 1,634 files.
- `bun run validate:contrast` passed both themes against WCAG AA, and `bun run test:e2e` passed 8/8
  Chromium tests after `db:migrate:local`.
- `bun run build:ci` compiled with the expected placeholder-binding warning. Every local gate has now
  been run against the current tree; none rest on earlier entries.

Merge attempt recorded on 2026-08-08 (third session):

- The branch is merged into **local** `main` (fast-forward, now `106c3ce`) and pushed to
  `fork/cursor/starspace-group-quality-pass-20260808`, which is PR #6's head.
- Publishing to `origin/main` is **impossible from this account**, confirmed empirically rather than
  inferred: `git push --dry-run origin main` returns
  `remote: Permission to starspacegroup/starspace-group-nebulakit.git denied to donaldfilimon` / HTTP 403. Local
  `main` was 29 commits ahead of `origin/main` at that time (35 as of 2026-08-09) and cannot be
  published. Squash-merging PR #6 needs the
  same write permission, so it is blocked on a maintainer of `starspacegroup/starspace-group-nebulakit`, as is
  approving the parked workflow run that leaves the PR `unstable` with zero checks.
- No direct push to `origin/main` was attempted beyond the dry run. Even with permission it would
  bypass the PR the ledger specifies, and would publish 29 commits to a public default branch.

Agent-guidance drift corrected on 2026-08-09 (fourth session):

- `CLAUDE.md` was last written at `2f3a4b0`; `db30a29` and `c7040ab` (the opaque-sessions merge)
  landed after it and falsified four statements. All four are fixed. Everything else in the file was
  re-verified against source and still holds: the 95 thresholds in `vite.config.ts`, `devPort: 4203`,
  the 14-file `git grep -ln "AGENTS.md §"` count, the CI job topology and `BUN_VERSION` pin, the
  `docs/` table, and the absence of a `lint`/`format` script.
- The migration inventory said `0001_`–`0012_`, next `0013_`, in three places — `CLAUDE.md`, the
  `Current Migrations` table in `migrations/README.md` (which omitted the row entirely), and the
  `0010_`-collision entry above. `0013_session_payload.sql` has landed; next is `0014_`. The
  `CLAUDE.md` numbering paragraph now carries `0013_` as its second worked example: it was authored
  as `0011_` on the opaque-sessions branch, `main` had meanwhile shipped `0011_` and `0012_`, and it
  took the next free slot at merge rather than anything on `main` being renamed.
- The auth paragraph still described the retired cookie scheme — "a signed opaque session token …
  its digest and expiry live in D1". Nothing is signed. Rewritten to the actual scheme: an opaque
  random token, the row keyed by its SHA-256, expiry **and** the trusted payload in `sessions.data`,
  `getAuthSession` failing closed on both a forged cookie and a pre-`0013_` row with no payload, and
  an explicit instruction not to reintroduce a cookie the hooks trust without a server-side lookup.
  Two further invariants were undocumented and are now recorded: the `datetime(expires_at)`
  normalization (a raw string compare sorts `'T'` after `' '` and reads a same-day expiry as valid
  for up to a day), and the two coexisting session APIs in `db.ts`.
- **Checked and found still true, so not changed as a finding:** the per-request privilege refresh
  survived the merge. `authHandler` takes identity from the stored payload but re-reads `is_admin`,
  `can_view_stats`, and owner status from `users` on every request, so the AGENTS.md Security
  Boundaries rule holds and revocation still needs no re-login. The `isPretend` bypass, gated on
  `isDevAuthSimulationEnabled`, is now stated explicitly rather than left implicit.
- Docs only, no source touched. `bunx prettier --check` clean on all three files, `git diff --check`
  clean, and `product-identity` + `agent-readiness` pass 53/53 — those are the suites that read these
  files off disk. No coverage or e2e claim is made, because nothing under coverage changed.
- Delivered as `46a0247` on `docs/agent-guidance-drift-20260809`, pushed to
  `fork/cursor/starspace-group-quality-pass-20260808` as a fast-forward from `c7040ab` — so **PR #6 now
  carries it** and reports `MERGEABLE` / `mergeStateStatus: CLEAN` at head `46a0247`. A fresh PR was
  considered and rejected: the corrections only parse on top of the opaque-sessions work, which is
  not on `origin/main`, so a new PR would have shown 36 commits rather than four doc files. PR #6's
  head is now 36 commits ahead of `origin/main`; local `main` is untouched at `c7040ab` (35 ahead).
- Noted, not acted on: PR #7 (`security/opaque-sessions`, base `main`) is open on the org repo and
  overlaps PR #6, which already contains the merge of that branch at `c7040ab`. Whoever merges these
  needs to decide the order; both cannot land independently without a conflict or an empty diff.
- Both open PRs are consolidated on `fork/dev` as of 2026-08-09, which fast-forwarded `c7040ab` →
  `952438c`. "All PRs" is two, and PR #7 needed no separate merge: its head `db30a29` is already an
  ancestor of PR #6's head, verified with `git merge-base --is-ancestor`. `fork/dev` now contains
  both heads.
- **This closes nothing and is not the acceptance criterion.** Both PRs target `starspacegroup:main`,
  so merging into a fork branch leaves them `OPEN`. The org repo has **no `dev` branch at all** —
  only `main`, `cms-v2-embeds`, and `security/opaque-sessions` — and one cannot be created from this
  account under the same 403. Note also that `ci.yml` triggers on `main`/`develop`, so a branch named
  `dev` would not run CI even if it existed on the org repo.

Delivery evidence recorded on 2026-08-10 (sixth session):

- The consolidation moved to a dedicated branch and PR: `consolidate/local-main-20260810` is PR
  [#9](https://github.com/starspacegroup/starspace-group-nebulakit/pull/9) (42 commits, head `8443b8b`, base
  `main`), and the heads of PR #6 (`46a0247`), PR #7 (`security/opaque-sessions`), and PR #8
  (`cms-v2-embeds`) are all ancestors of that head — verified with `git merge-base --is-ancestor`,
  so merging #9 strictly contains all three.
- **The hosted-checks blocker is resolved for PR #9.** A maintainer approved the fork-PR workflow
  runs, and CI has now executed on `starspacegroup/starspace-group-nebulakit` for the first time. Both jobs are
  green at head `8443b8b`: Test & Coverage and E2E Tests, run `31439300377` (2026-08-10). PR #9
  reports `MERGEABLE` / `mergeStateStatus: CLEAN`. Getting there took two fixes this session:
  `e3b87b9` regenerated `bun.lock` with released Bun 1.3.14 (a canary had written
  `lockfileVersion: 2`, which the pinned CI Bun cannot parse, so `--frozen-lockfile` aborted at
  install), and `8443b8b` fixed an E2E command-palette hydration race. Nine Codex review findings
  on #9 were also addressed, replied to, and resolved (`b44470c` and follow-ups).
- **PR #6 now runs CI and fails both jobs** at `bun install --frozen-lockfile` (run `31434971833`):
  its head still carries the canary `bun.lock`. Not fixed there deliberately — its head is an
  ancestor of #9's, and pushing a lockfile commit to it would fork the lineage for a PR that #9
  supersedes. The failure is an argument for merging #9 and closing #6, not a regression to chase.
- **Still blocked, re-verified today — publication.** `git push --dry-run origin main` returns
  `Permission to starspacegroup/starspace-group-nebulakit.git denied to donaldfilimon` (403), unchanged. The
  remaining acceptance step is a maintainer squash-merging PR #9 and closing the superseded PRs
  (#6, #7, and #8's content all land with it). The squash message still needs the
  `Co-Authored-By: David Monaghan <monaghan.david@gmail.com>` trailer for the `cms-v2-embeds`
  lineage commits.
- `CLAUDE.md`'s CI paragraph claimed the workflow had never executed; falsified by the runs above
  and rewritten this session with the run ids, including PR #6's live demonstration of the
  canary-lockfile trap the same file documents.

## Explicitly outside this worktree

- [~] After *Space is merged, audit whether the same inherited fixes apply to Guides, nabu, and
  sortalizer in separate repository branches. Do not stage sibling-repository files here.
- [ ] Record any remaining design decision or external blocker without claiming completion.

Sibling audit, read-only pass recorded on 2026-08-08 (fourth session):

- The audit's read-only half does not depend on the merge gate, so it was run; propagation of any fix
  still waits on PR #6 landing. No sibling-repository file was staged, edited, or committed.
- **4 of the 7 P0 items were compared** across Guides, nabu, and sortalizer. Not yet audited:
  sanitize-before-`{@html}`, one-time OAuth state consumption, and the coverage-inclusion item.
  ~~Not yet audited~~ — all three were completed on 2026-08-09; see the block below. The read-only
  half of the audit is now **7 of 7** and complete. Propagation still waits on PR #6, so the item
  stays `[~]`.
- `isSuperAdmin` (the `e0e509c` fix): **does not apply.** The identifier does not appear anywhere in
  Guides, nabu, or sortalizer `src/`. It exists only in *Space (`app.d.ts`, `auth-guards.ts`,
  `stats-guard.ts`), so the guard-divergence it fixed cannot occur in the siblings.
- Admin-users PII masking: **already present** in Guides and sortalizer — both use `requireAdmin`
  plus `isPiiRevealed`/`maskEmail`/`maskGeneric`, matching *Space. **nabu is not exposed and needs
  no port:** it has no `pii-mask.ts` but gates all three admin-users endpoints on `requireOwner`,
  which is strictly stronger than *Space's `requireAdmin`-plus-mask (nabu's own `auth-guards.ts`
  defines `requireAdmin` as owner-or-admin and `requireOwner` as owner-only). The residual difference
  is that *Space masks by default even for the owner until an explicit reveal cookie is set; that
  is a hardening delta, not a leak.
- Destructive reset and authentication-key administration: **owner-gated in all four repositories.**
  No gap.
- **Open finding — Guides only.** `Guides/src/routes/api/admin/users/[id]/+server.ts` guards PATCH
  and DELETE with an inline `if (!locals.user.isOwner && !locals.user.isAdmin)`, so **any admin can
  promote an arbitrary user to admin or delete users.** *Space restricted both handlers to
  `requireOwner` in `924a5ac` ("Retire the template workflow; harden auth and the OAuth write path"),
  and nabu and sortalizer both use `requireOwner` there. Guides is the only outlier and never
  received the change — the sole commit touching that file is `4aefa9c`, unrelated. Verified not a
  false positive: `Guides/src/hooks.server.ts` adds no route guard (it only populates `locals.user`,
  with `isAdmin: is_admin === 1 || isOwner`), and no `+layout.server.ts` covers `src/routes/api`. The
  only limits are the self-modification check and the KV `setup:complete` owner-email check, so a
  non-owner admin can still escalate any other account.
- The sibling `search/` and `[id]/` endpoints in Guides and sortalizer use inline
  authenticate-then-authorize blocks rather than the shared `auth-guards` helpers. Behaviour was read
  and matches `requireAdmin` in every case checked, so this is a divergence risk rather than a
  defect — the same class of drift that `93bf6aa` caused in *Space.
- Guides is checked out on `cursor/guides-main-security-20260808` with a clean tree, but that branch
  is **empty**: `git log main..HEAD` and `git diff --stat main...HEAD` both return nothing. It does
  not already carry this fix.

Sibling audit, remaining three P0 items, read-only pass on 2026-08-09 (fifth session). Still no
sibling-repository file staged, edited, or committed — every result below is from reading source.

- **Sanitize-before-`{@html}`: no gap, and the scope of that claim is every `{@html}` in each repo,
  not a sample.** sortalizer has no `src/lib/cms/` and no `{@html}` anywhere, so it is not exposed.
  nabu covers both halves of the AGENTS.md rule: `sanitizeContentFields` on create (`cms.ts:142`)
  and update (`cms.ts:343`), and again at the render boundary in
  `[contentType]/[slug]/+page.server.ts:60`, so the raw-looking `{@html item.fields.body}` in its
  `+page.svelte` receives already-sanitized fields. Guides has **no HTML sanitizer and no `xss`
  dependency at all**, which looks alarming and is not: it has exactly three `{@html}` sites, and
  all three are safe by construction. Two render `renderMarkdownToHtml`, a hand-rolled renderer that
  escapes its entire input first (`markdown.ts:147`) and routes every href through `sanitizeHref`;
  the third is a hardcoded SVG string literal (`profile/+page.svelte:214`). Guides stores Markdown
  where *Space stores rich-text HTML, so the *Space sanitizer does not apply to it — different
  content model, not a missing fix.
- **One-time OAuth state: no gap.** All four repositories persist an `oauth_transactions` row and
  consume it with a single atomic statement — `UPDATE ... WHERE id = ? AND provider = ? AND
consumed_at IS NULL AND datetime(expires_at) > CURRENT_TIMESTAMP RETURNING intent, user_id,
session_id` — then reject intent mismatch and, for `link`, require the row's `session_id` to match
  the hash of the caller's live session. Only the packaging differs: nabu keeps it at
  `src/lib/server/oauth-state.ts` rather than `src/lib/utils/`, and sortalizer ships a single
  `migrations/schema.sql` instead of numbered files, so its table is there rather than in an
  `oauth_transactions` migration. **A first pass called sortalizer's expiry check missing; that was a
  false positive** — a truncated `grep` had cut the `datetime(expires_at)` line, which is present.
- **Open finding — nabu only. `vite.config.ts` excludes `src/hooks.server.ts` from coverage**
  ("Hooks are tested implicitly through integration tests"), which is precisely the P0 item
  *Space closed. *Space, Guides, and sortalizer all measure it. The exclusion matters more in
  nabu than the same line would elsewhere: nabu's `handle` is `sequence(authHandler)`, so that one
  file **is** the entire authorization boundary, where *Space's is one handler of four. It is not
  untested — `tests/unit/hooks-owner-admin.test.ts` covers owner-not-demoted, non-owner demoted,
  non-owner promoted, and a forged cookie — but its harness supplies `DB: { prepare }` in all four
  cases, so the `if (!db) throw new Error('Session database unavailable')` fail-closed branch is
  exercised by nothing, and the 95% floor cannot notice, because the file is not measured. That
  branch is the AGENTS.md rule "auth fails closed when D1 … is unavailable." Severity is below the
  Guides escalation — no live privilege gap was found — but the gate that would catch one is off.
  The fix is deleting one line, and it belongs in a nabu branch.
- Not claimed: no sibling test suite or coverage run was executed. These are source-reading results,
  so the nabu conclusion is "that branch has no test that reaches it and no gate measures the file,"
  not a measured coverage percentage.
