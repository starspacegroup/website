/**
 * Single source of truth for app identity, branding, and local-dev config.
 *
 * When you spin up a new app from this template, DO NOT hand-edit the scattered
 * references. Run `bun run customize` (see CUSTOMIZE.md at the repo root), which
 * rewrites this file and syncs the surfaces that cannot import it — wrangler.toml
 * (Cloudflare resource names), tests, and docs.
 *
 * Everything that runs (Vite, Playwright, and every Svelte component) imports its
 * name/port/URL from here, so these values live in exactly one place.
 *
 * This module must stay dependency-free (no `$app`, no Node APIs) so that
 * vite.config.ts and playwright.config.ts can import it directly.
