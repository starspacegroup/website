<!--
  CmsContent — public renderer for CMS richtext HTML.

  Content is stored as HTML with atom placeholders:

    <div data-svelte-embed="name" data-props="{&quot;key&quot;:1}"></div>

  A plain {@html} of that string emits the empty <div> and the component never
  mounts, so every richtext surface must render through this component instead.
  The sanitizer runs once at this rendering boundary for defense in depth over
  legacy/imported rows. parseContentSegments then splits the safe HTML into
  plain runs and embed segments; each embed resolves through the registry.

  An embed whose component is not registered renders nothing. The registry
  ships empty, so "not registered" is *Space's default state rather than
  an error worth surfacing to a visitor.
