# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

**[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) is the canonical rules file** — coverage floor, migration immutability, CSS variables, scratch files, product identity, icon set, `/documentation` sync, and agent-discovery surfaces. Read it first; it is sized to fit the 200-line memory budget. This file holds the commands, architecture, and Claude-specific context that AGENTS.md deliberately leaves out, and cross-references its rules by section number rather than restating them. `§N` means the **Nth bullet of AGENTS.md's "Release Rules" list**, in order. Renumbering that list is expensive: `git grep -ln "AGENTS.md §"` currently returns 14 tracked files, four of them shipped source (`src/lib/agent-discovery.ts`, `src/lib/server/agent-skills.ts`, `src/routes/[x+2e]well-known/api-catalog/+server.ts`, `src/routes/auth.md/+server.ts`) plus `vite.config.ts`, `ci.yml`, two docs, and five test files. Re-run that grep before touching the list.

AGENTS.md also opens by requiring `tasks/goals.md` and `tasks/todo.md` be read before editing, alongside `git status --short --branch`. Both files are checked in and carry the current work ledger; uncommitted changes in the tree are user-owned and must never be discarded, rewritten, or staged implicitly.

## Commands

Package manager is **Bun** — `bun.lock` is the sole lockfile, CI installs with `bun install --frozen-lockfile`, and package-script orchestration uses `bun run`/`bunx` throughout.

```bash
bun run dev              # dev server on port 4203 (from src/lib/site.config.ts)
bun run build            # → .svelte-kit/cloudflare
bun run build:ci         # local CI compile; warns on intentional placeholder bindings
bun run check            # svelte-kit sync && svelte-check
bun run test             # vitest run
bun run test:coverage    # vitest run --coverage — fails below 95% (the real gate)
bun run test:e2e         # db:migrate:local, then playwright
bun run validate:contrast   # WCAG contrast check over src/app.css themes
bun run validate:all     # check + test + validate:contrast
bun run deploy           # build + wrangler pages deploy
```

Single test: `bunx vitest run tests/unit/cms-service.test.ts` or `bunx vitest run -t "creates a content item"`.

There is **no `lint` or `format` script**. Prettier + `prettier-plugin-svelte` are installed with `.prettierrc`/`.prettierignore` in place — run `bunx prettier --write .` or `bunx prettier --check .` directly. The workspace table also lists this project's dev port as "default"; it is **4203**, set in `site.config.ts` and read by both Vite and Playwright.

`.github/copilot-instructions.md` defers to AGENTS.md and adds one rule of its own — assume a dev server is already running on 4203, don't start another. That rule is scoped to Copilot Chat, not to Claude Code; start the dev server yourself when you need it, after checking 4203 is free.

Setup / maintenance scripts (`scripts/`): `setup:cf` (create the Cloudflare D1/KV/R2 resources and write real ids into `wrangler.toml`), `check:bindings`, `db:migrate` / `db:migrate:local` / `db:migrate:list`, `palette:scan`, `tunnel` / `dev:tunnel` (cloudflared).

### Coverage: one gate, 95, in `vite.config.ts`

`vite.config.ts` sets vitest `thresholds` of **95** for lines, functions, branches, and statements — so `test:coverage`, and therefore CI's coverage step, fails below 95 on all four. This matches AGENTS.md §1. There is deliberately no second gate: CI used to carry a `jq` step nominally checking 90% that read a `coverage-summary.json` nothing generated, so it always passed. Don't reintroduce a number outside the thresholds block — that split is what let the docs drift to 90 while the real floor was 95.

### What CI actually runs

`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, on push and PR to `main`/`develop`, with Bun pinned to `1.3.14`. **Regenerate `bun.lock` only with a released Bun.** A canary (e.g. `1.4.0-canary.1`) writes `lockfileVersion: 2`, which no released Bun can parse, so `--frozen-lockfile` aborts at install before a single test runs — and `setup-bun` cannot install a canary tag either, so raising the pin to match is not a fix. Check `bun --revision` before running `bun install`; if it reports a canary, regenerate with a downloaded release build instead:

- **`test`** — `bun run check` → `bun run validate:contrast` → `bun run build:ci` → `bun run test:coverage` → codecov upload (`fail_ci_if_error: false`, so an upload failure does not fail that step; whether a codecov status blocks a PR is branch-protection state, not something this file settles).
- **`e2e`** — `bunx playwright install --with-deps`, then `bun run test:e2e`. E2E is meant to gate in CI, not only locally.
- **No deploy job.** Cloudflare Pages auto-deploy is disabled for this repository, because the placeholder ids in `wrangler.toml` make a production build fail by design (see `docs/CLOUDFLARE_SETUP.md`).

This describes the workflow's _intended_ gates. Per AGENTS.md's Verification rule, don't report them as passing without observing a run. The workflow now has observed runs on `starspacegroup/starspace-group-nebulakit`: both jobs passed on PR #7's head (2026-08-08, run `31262364171`) and on PR #9's head `8443b8b` (2026-08-10, run `31439300377`). Before 2026-08-08 it had never executed — the fork-PR approval gate parked fork-PR runs at `action_required` with zero jobs, and that gate still applies to each new fork-PR push until a maintainer approves the run. The canary-lockfile trap above is not hypothetical: PR #6's head still carries a `lockfileVersion: 2` `bun.lock` and fails both jobs at install (run `31434971833`); the regenerated lockfile landed on PR #9's branch as `e3b87b9`.

`bun run validate:all` is **not** the CI gate. It runs `test`, not `test:coverage`, so the 95% floor never fires under it, and it skips `build:ci` and E2E entirely. To reproduce CI locally, run the four `test`-job commands in order and then `bun run test:e2e`.

## Architecture

SvelteKit 2 + **Svelte 5** (`^5.56.8`) + TypeScript run on Cloudflare Pages (`@sveltejs/adapter-cloudflare`). Existing components largely use Svelte's legacy-compatible `export let`, `$:`, and store syntax; match the surrounding file unless a deliberate migration is in scope. Bindings come in through `event.platform.env`: `DB` (D1), `KV`, and `BUCKET` (R2). There is no ORM; database access uses parameterized D1 statements (`src/lib/utils/db.ts`).

**`src/lib/site.config.ts` is the single source of truth for identity.** Name, slug, tagline, `devPort: 4203`, production URL, repo, author. `vite.config.ts` and `playwright.config.ts` both import it directly, which is why the file must stay dependency-free (no `$app`, no Node APIs) — adding an import there breaks the build config. Surfaces that _can't_ import it (`wrangler.toml`, tests, docs, `src/app.html`, `static/site.webmanifest`) are kept in sync by `bun run customize` (`scripts/customize.mjs`), which is the rebranding pass a downstream app runs once — see [CUSTOMIZE.md](CUSTOMIZE.md). `tests/unit/product-identity.test.ts` reads README, FEATURES, `site.config.ts`, `/documentation`, `app.html`, and the manifest off disk and fails when they drift; that failure is intentional.

**`src/hooks.server.ts` — the sequence order is load-bearing.**

```
sequence(usageHandler, agentDiscoveryHandler, authHandler, pageViewsHandler)
```

- `usageHandler` first, so requests that return early still count against the Cloudflare plan meter (it counts _every_ invocation, buffered in-process and flushed on a rate limit).
- `pageViewsHandler` last, so `locals.user` is populated and `signed_in` is accurate. It counts only non-bot HTML `GET` 200s on matched, non-`/admin|/api|/setup` routes.
- `agentDiscoveryHandler` sits _outside_ that pair so `pageViewsHandler` still sees a `text/html` response and keeps counting agent reads as views.

Each handler is exported individually because `sequence()` needs Kit's request store — unit tests call them directly. Reordering silently corrupts analytics rather than failing a test.

**CMS is registry-driven.** Content types are declared in `src/lib/cms/registry.ts`, synced to D1 on first access, and the routes generate themselves: `src/routes/[contentType]/`, `[contentType]/[slug]/`, and `admin/cms/[type]/`. Adding a type means adding a definition object, not adding routes. Embeds are split on purpose: `src/lib/cms/embeds/manifest.ts` carries metadata with **zero `.svelte` imports** so Workers, Vitest, and browser code can all load it; `embeds/index.ts` holds the actual components.

**Timestamp proofs are a CMS opt-in whose hash must stay reproducible.** A content type sets `settings.enableTimestampProof` (`src/lib/cms/types.ts`), and on **first publish only** — `item.publishedAt` in `api/cms/[type]/+server.ts`, `!existing.publishedAt && item.publishedAt` in `api/cms/[type]/[id]/+server.ts` — the route hands `runTimestampProofJob` to `platform?.context?.waitUntil()`. The job (`src/lib/content-proof/proof-job.ts`) computes a SHA-256 over the sorted-key JSON of title/slug/body/date-window (`content-proof/hash.ts`), requests an RFC 3161 token (`timestamp/rfc3161.ts`), triggers a Wayback capture (`timestamp/wayback.ts`), and records the outcome in the `timestamp_proof_*` / `wayback_*` columns added by `0010_`. Three properties are load-bearing:

- The hash is computed once and **never** recomputed. A third party can only re-derive it because `lockedAfterPublish` (per field, enforced in `src/lib/cms/utils.ts`) and `lockTitleAndSlugAfterPublish` (`src/lib/services/cms.ts`) genuinely freeze those fields after publish. Weaken either lock and every existing proof silently stops verifying — nothing fails at write time.
- The job never throws. It runs detached from a response that already went back to the client, so it records the failure instead of propagating it.
- `waitUntil` is optional-chained, so an environment without it skips the job entirely. That is what `api/cms/[type]/[id]/timestamp-retry/` exists to repair, alongside `wayback-check/`.

There is no `docs/` note for this subsystem; the source comments and `tests/unit/content-proof-*.test.ts` / `rfc3161.test.ts` / `wayback.test.ts` are the specification.

**Auth is hand-rolled — there is no auth library in the request path.** The browser receives an opaque random token (`createSessionToken`); the `sessions` row is keyed by its SHA-256 (`hashSessionToken`), and both the expiry and the trusted user payload live in D1 (`sessions.data`, added by `0013_`). Three properties of that scheme are load-bearing:

- `getAuthSession` fails closed. A forged cookie names no session, and a row written before `0013_` carries no payload and resolves to `null`. Nothing is signed — the cookie is worthless on its own, which is the point. `encodeSession`/`decodeSessionCookie` were deleted along with the old base64-JSON cookie, which let anyone set `isOwner`/`isAdmin` by hand; **do not reintroduce a cookie the hooks trust without a server-side lookup.**
- Its expiry check is `datetime(expires_at) > datetime('now')`. The `datetime()` wrapper is not cosmetic: the column holds an ISO string (`...T...Z`) and a raw compare sorts `'T'` after `' '`, so a same-day expiry reads as still valid for up to a day.
- `db.ts` carries two session APIs. `createAuthSession` / `replaceAuthSession` / `getAuthSession` are the opaque-cookie path `authHandler` uses; `createSession` / `findValidSession` are the older pair. Reach for the wrong one and the payload is never written, so the session resolves to `null` on the next request.

`authHandler` takes identity from the stored payload but **re-reads `is_admin`, `can_view_stats`, and owner status from `users` on every request**, so granting or revoking access takes effect without a re-login. The one exception is an `isPretend` payload, which is used as-is and only when `isDevAuthSimulationEnabled` — a simulated identity in a production database must not authenticate anyone. Per-provider OAuth route pairs under `src/routes/api/auth/{github,discord}/` persist and atomically consume one-time state transactions; email/password lives at `login`, `signup`, and `password`. Provider availability is resolved from `platform.env` or KV `auth_config:<provider>`; account linking lives in `src/lib/services/account-merge.ts`. Authorization checks belong in `src/lib/server/auth-guards.ts` and are reused from there rather than re-derived per route — server loads and API handlers each guard themselves, because hiding UI is not authorization. `@auth/core` and `@auth/sveltekit` were declared dependencies that nothing imported — removed. Don't re-add them without actually wiring Auth.js in.

**Agent discovery** (robots.txt, sitemap, `.well-known/`, `auth.md`, Markdown content negotiation, WebMCP) — see AGENTS.md §8, which is the full contract including the honesty rule about not advertising endpoints that don't exist. `tests/unit/agent-readiness.test.ts` fails when a new public route isn't registered in `src/lib/agent-discovery.ts`; that failure is intentional.

**Chat and AI keys** are spread across `src/lib/services/openai-chat.ts` (streaming text plus realtime voice, and the model allow-lists), `src/routes/api/chat/`, `src/routes/admin/ai-keys/`, `src/lib/utils/cost.ts`, and `src/lib/stores/chatHistory.ts`; behavior is specified in `UNIFIED_CHAT_INTERFACE.md` and `VOICE_CHAT_IMPLEMENTATION.md`.

**`wrangler.toml` ships placeholder resource ids that fail loudly by design.** `bun run dev` warns, `bun run build` fails, and remote migration/deploy paths fail until the ids are safe. `bun run build:ci` is the local-only exception: it warns and compiles without contacting Cloudflare. A previous version shipped real ids and six sibling products inherited one D1 and one KV, including shared OAuth secrets. Run `bun run setup:cf` rather than pasting ids from a sibling project.

### Migrations

`migrations/` is D1-native — wrangler sorts `.sql` files by numeric prefix and then by string, and records applied ones in `d1_migrations` **by filename**. A filename already on `main` is already applied and is immutable (AGENTS.md §2, `migrations/README.md`). The sequence runs `0001_`–`0013_`, the next is `0014_`.

Numbering is the part that actually goes wrong here, twice now. An earlier state of this branch had two files sharing a `0010_` prefix, because the new pair was numbered from the branch's own highest file rather than from what was already on `origin/main`. Ordering between same-prefix files falls to the string comparison, not the number, which is not what anyone reading `NNNN_` expects. **Take the next number from `origin/main`, not from your branch** — and if a collision does land, it is only fixable while the colliding files are still branch-local and unapplied to any remote D1. `0013_session_payload.sql` is the same mistake caught before it landed: it was authored as `0011_` on the opaque-sessions branch, `main` had meanwhile shipped `0011_` and `0012_`, and it took the next free slot at merge. Its header records the renumbering — do that rather than renaming anything already on `main`.

`scripts/db-migrate.mjs` reads `database_name` out of `wrangler.toml` and refuses to run against a placeholder — but **only for remote runs**. Line 63 exempts `--local` (`/REPLACE_ME/.test(name) && !LOCAL`), and `check-bindings.mjs` is invoked with `--warn` in that path. That exemption is load-bearing: it is what lets `db:migrate:local`, and therefore `test:e2e`, work on a fresh clone before `setup:cf` has ever run. Don't "fix" it. The remote strictness is the point — shared-database migrations are how one D1 once accumulated four projects' interleaved tables.

### Test topology

- Two homes: colocated `src/**/*.test.ts` and the bulk in `tests/unit/`. Both are in the vitest `include`. E2E is `tests/e2e/` (Playwright, excluded from vitest).
- Coverage **excludes** `**/*.svelte`, `src/routes/**/+page.ts`, `src/lib/site.config.ts`, `scripts/`, and `.remember/` tool scratch data. Authorization hooks are measured directly. The 95% floor therefore applies to product `.ts` logic; component tests exist and run, but do not count toward it.
- `pool: 'threads'` with `fileParallelism: false` (test files run one at a time, not concurrently), plus `unstubGlobals: true`. The last one is not optional: several suites stub `crypto` with a bare `{ randomUUID }`, and because files share a worker serially that object leaks into every later _file_ without it. Symptom is a suite that passes alone and fails in a full run.

## Claude-specific

- **Task tracking:** use `TaskCreate` / `TaskUpdate` / `TaskList` for multi-step work — mark in-progress before starting and completed immediately after, not in batches.
- **Scratch files** go to `.llm-outputs/` (AGENTS.md §4). The directory exists and is gitignored.
- ***Space is the site, not the starter** (AGENTS.md §5). This repository is starspace.group. It was created from NebulaKit and keeps the whole platform, but no public surface may describe it as a template — `tests/unit/product-identity.test.ts` asserts the absence of that copy, inverted from the guard the template shipped. The rebranding path (`bun run customize`, `CUSTOMIZE.md`, `docs/INITIAL_CUSTOMIZATION.md`, the `INITIAL_CUSTOMIZATION_STATUS.md` ledger, now `status: complete`) is kept for forks; don't run it again here. Upstream is the `template` remote — there is deliberately no `origin`, so a stray push cannot land in NebulaKit.

- **The public content is checked-in data.** `src/lib/data/projects.ts` backs `/projects`; `featuredProjects` is the head of the same list, so the home shelf and the directory cannot drift. Artwork lives in `static/projects/` as ~900px WebP, and `tests/unit/site-content.test.ts` fails when an entry names a file that is not on disk. The Discord invite code lives once, in `src/lib/discord.ts`. Deliberately not CMS-backed: the page has to render on a clone that has never been pointed at D1. A `/sister-spaces` route existed and was parked on 2026-09-04 — see `tasks/todo.md`; restore it from git rather than rewriting it.
- **The brand has one source.** `brand/starspace-mark.png` is the carved-wood *Space star; `bun run build:brand` (`scripts/build-brand.mjs`) regenerates the favicons, the install icons, `og-image.png` and `static/brand/starspace-mark.webp` from it. Files in `static/` that the script writes are build output — edit the master or `brand/og-image.svg` and re-run, don't touch them directly. Two traps it already hit: `String.replace` on the `{{MARK}}` placeholder substituted the mention in the SVG's own comment and shipped a card with no star; and the wood texture needs quantising (`-colors 256`) or a 512px install icon lands at 570K.

- **Shared history with siblings:** `Guides`, `nabu`, and `sortalizer` share historical code with this repo. A security or correctness fix here likely applies there too and may warrant an explicit cross-repository audit; see Related Projects in AGENTS.md.
