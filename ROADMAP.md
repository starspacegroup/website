# *Space Roadmap

Planned additions, sourced primarily from features built downstream in
*Space-derived projects that proved generalizable. Each entry identifies the source
and, where the module layout is what makes it liftable, sketches that layout so
implementation starts from a known shape rather than a blank file.

Downstream projects surveyed (2026-07-06):

| Project                               | Divergence from *Space                                       |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Nabu                                  | Large — media/AI-generation platform                            |
| Payments/credits downstream app       | Large — consumer app with Stripe checkout and a credits ledger  |
| CMS-heavy downstream site             | Large — CMS v2 (WYSIWYG + Svelte embeds + R2 media), task board |
| Two near-stock downstream deployments | Near-stock (one removed the simulated-SSO "PRETEND" providers)  |

## Upstream candidates — new modules

### Payments: Stripe integration + PPP region pricing (from the payments/credits app)

A complete, *Space-shaped Stripe module: checkout, product/price/discount management from
the admin area, appearance matching *Space's theme system, and — as a **first-class
concept, not a bolt-on — purchasing-power-parity (PPP) region pricing**. Full design in
[`docs/PAYMENTS_AND_PPP.md`](./docs/PAYMENTS_AND_PPP.md); read it before starting this.

- `src/lib/components/StripeCheckoutForm.svelte`
- `src/lib/utils/stripe.ts`, `stripe-config.ts`, `stripe-appearance.ts`
- **PPP region pricing:** `src/lib/utils/region-pricing.ts` (country→currency map,
  zero-decimal/whole-unit formatting, geo via `cf-ipcountry`, per-currency amount
  table), `scripts/setup-region-prices.ts` (add-only writer of Stripe
  `currency_options`; refuses live keys without `--live`), `src/lib/utils/fx.ts`
  (admin-preview USD reference). Key architecture: PPP rides on `currency_options` of
  **existing** prices — no new price IDs, no migration, entitlement/webhook logic
  untouched. The downstream amount table is product-specific; generalize it into
  app-defined price roles (see the design doc).
- Admin UI: `src/routes/admin/stripe/` (products, discounts) and
  `src/routes/api/admin/stripe-*` (config, bootstrap, products, prices, coupons,
  promotion-codes, options)
- The `stripe-bootstrap` endpoint (idempotent first-time product/price setup) matches how
  the rest of *Space provisions itself: run a script, not a hand-edited env file.

### Credits / points ledger (from the payments/credits app)

The downstream implementation is a general credits system wearing a product-specific
name: balance, append-only transaction ledger, purchase via Stripe, weekly allowance
cron, and an admin transactions view. Upstream as a generic **credits** module.

- A balance module, an append-only ledger module, and their D1 query layer under `src/lib/utils/`.
- Paired API and admin transaction routes under `src/routes/api/` and `src/routes/admin/`.
- A weekly-allowance cron route under `src/routes/api/cron/`.
- Pairs with the Stripe module through a credit-purchase flow under `account/`.

### Media library on R2 (from Nabu)

Upload, gallery, detail modal, and a file archive service over *Space's existing R2
binding — the missing "user uploads" story.

- `src/lib/components/MediaUpload.svelte`, `MediaGallery.svelte`, `ImageDetailModal.svelte`,
  `FileArchive.svelte`
- `src/lib/services/file-archive.ts`, `media-history.ts`, `src/lib/utils/attachments.ts`
- `src/routes/api/archive/` (+ `file`, `ai-save`)

### CMS v2: WYSIWYG richtext + Svelte component embeds (from the CMS-heavy downstream site)

> **Status: ✅ shipped (2026-07-12), with improvements.** The TipTap WYSIWYG,
> Svelte embed system, and R2 media pipeline are all in *Space and tested.
> Beyond a straight port, the embed system gained **typed props** (schema-driven
> auto-generated editor form, no raw-JSON editing), **one-step registration**
> (drop a folder under `src/lib/cms/embeds/<name>/` — auto-discovered via
> `import.meta.glob`), and **SSR embeds** (eager component registry). Write-path
> hardening (`sanitizeRichtextFields`, using `xss`) runs on every create/update.
> A brand-neutral **Callout** reference embed ships as a live example (the
> CMS-heavy site's Dirac physics embeds were intentionally left downstream). See
> [docs/CMS_EMBEDS.md](./docs/CMS_EMBEDS.md). **Remaining:** the opt-in
> markdown-blog-import recipe (item 4 below) is not yet ported.

**Goal: *Space's CMS grows up.** That site took the registry-driven CMS and made
authoring actually pleasant — a real WYSIWYG editor, live Svelte components embedded
inside richtext content, and an R2 image pipeline wired into the editor. Bring the
whole system into *Space, and improve it where the downstream version cut corners.
This is the flagship CMS upgrade; land it before the smaller CMS backports below.

What downstream built (three changes: TipTap WYSIWYG, Svelte embed system, R2 media
pipeline):

1. **TipTap WYSIWYG for `richtext` fields** — replaces raw markdown textareas.
   Round-trips stored HTML, hardened write path (server-side sanitize on save,
   not just render).
   - `src/lib/components/RichTextEditor.svelte`
   - `src/lib/cms/sanitize.ts`, `richtext-utils.ts`
2. **Svelte embed system** — authors drop _real, interactive Svelte components_
   into content. Stored as inert placeholder divs
   (`<div data-svelte-embed="name" data-props="...">`), so content stays plain
   sanitizable HTML in D1:
   - `src/lib/cms/embed.ts` — the single placeholder codec, pure string logic
     (runs in Workers, Vitest, browser — no DOM)
   - `src/lib/cms/richtext-embed-extension.ts` — TipTap atom node; renders as a
     non-editable card with props-edit/remove (live component is NOT mounted in
     the editor — keeps editing cheap and predictable)
   - `src/lib/cms/embeds/manifest.ts` — embed metadata, deliberately free of
     `.svelte` imports; `embeds/index.ts` — the name → component map
   - `src/lib/components/CmsContent.svelte` — public renderer: parses stored HTML
     into html/embed segments and mounts the real components
   - Sanitizer allowlists the placeholder shape; unknown embed names render as
     nothing rather than breaking the page
   - Reference embeds: the Dirac physics visualizations (`src/lib/cms/embeds/dirac/`)
     prove the pattern with canvas animation + interactivity
3. **R2 media pipeline** — image upload from inside the editor, served from
   *Space's R2 binding (`src/lib/cms/upload.ts` + media routes). Overlaps the
   "Media library on R2 (from Nabu)" entry above — reconcile into ONE media
   module that both the CMS editor and the archive/gallery consume.
4. **Blog-as-CMS pattern** — markdown blog imported into the CMS
   (`src/lib/cms/blog-import.ts`, migration `0010`), old routes 308-redirected.
   Ship as an opt-in import script + a documented "retire your markdown blog"
   recipe.

Make it better in *Space ("maybe even better"):

- **Typed embed props.** Downstream edits props as raw JSON. Give `EmbedDefinition`
  a props schema (zod or JSON Schema) and auto-generate the props form in the
  editor card — validation for free, no JSON hand-editing.
- **One-step embed registration.** Manifest + component map is two files to keep
  in sync; collapse to a single registration (or glob-discover `embeds/*/`)
  so adding an embed is one file drop, matching the content-type registry's
  "add it to the array, that's it" ethos.
- **Optional live preview.** The card-not-component tradeoff is right as a default,
  but offer a per-embed `preview: true` that mounts the real component (or a
  sandboxed iframe) inside the editor for visual-critical embeds.
- **SSR the embeds where possible** so embedded components paint with the page
  instead of popping in on hydrate.
- **Theme-token aware.** Reference embeds should consume *Space's theme system
  (design tokens) rather than hardcoded colors, so they look native in any app.
- **Revision history tie-in.** Pairs with the "revision-history pattern" entry
  below — richtext + embeds are exactly the fields you want revert for.
- **Reconcile with the payments/credits app's `escapeHtml` XSS hardening** (see
  Backports) so *Space ships one coherent sanitize story: escape on render,
  sanitize on write, allowlisted embed placeholders.

### AI generation provider framework (from Nabu)

Pluggable text/image/video generation behind a provider registry, with job status and
progress. Extends *Space's existing LLM chat + admin ai-keys pages.

- `src/lib/services/ai-text-generation.ts`, `ai-media-generation.ts`,
  `video-provider.ts`, `video-registry.ts`
- Providers: `src/lib/services/providers/openai-video.ts`, `wavespeed-video.ts`,
  `src/lib/services/video/veo3.ts`
- UI: `src/lib/components/AIGenerateModal.svelte`, `AITextQuickGenerate.svelte`
- Admin ai-keys extensions: reorder + per-provider validate/pricing endpoints
  (`src/routes/api/admin/ai-keys/{reorder,wavespeed-validate,wavespeed-pricing}`)

### Chat upgrades: attachments + persisted conversations (from Nabu)

- `ChatAttachment`/`MediaAttachment` types with generating/complete/error status and
  progress on messages (`src/lib/stores/chatHistory.ts`, `ChatInterface.svelte`,
  `ChatSidebar.svelte`)
- Server-persisted conversations: `src/routes/api/chat/conversations/`

### Admin: PII privacy mode (from the payments/credits app)

Masks personal data in admin views by default, with an explicit reveal action —
a good default for any *Space app with an admin area.

- `src/lib/components/admin/ObfuscatedText.svelte`, `ObfuscatedAvatar.svelte`,
  `PiiPrivacyToggle.svelte`
- `src/lib/server/pii-mask.ts`, `src/routes/api/admin/pii-reveal/`

### Admin: user impersonation (from the payments/credits app)

Log in as a user for support/debugging, with an explicit stop/exit.

- `src/routes/api/auth/impersonation/` (+ `stop`)
- Session plumbing in `src/lib/utils/auth-session.ts`

### Admin: stats dashboard & user management (from the payments/credits app)

- `src/routes/admin/stats/`, `src/routes/admin/user/`

### System prompts admin (from the payments/credits app)

Manage LLM system prompts from the admin area with a test-generate loop — natural
companion to *Space's chat UI.

- `src/lib/utils/db/system-prompts.ts`, `src/routes/admin/system-prompts/`,
  `src/routes/api/admin/system-prompts/` (+ `test-generate`)

### Contact form + submissions inbox (from the payments/credits app)

Public contact form (Turnstile-protected) with an admin review queue.

- `src/routes/api/contact-form-submissions/`, `src/routes/admin/contact-form-submission(s)/`,
  `src/lib/utils/db/contacts.ts`

### Onboarding flow (from Nabu)

Chat-driven guided onboarding with progress tracking.

- `src/lib/components/OnboardingChat.svelte`, `OnboardingProgress.svelte`
- `src/lib/services/onboarding.ts`, `src/lib/stores/onboarding.ts`, `src/lib/types/onboarding.ts`

### External connections / publishing framework (from Nabu)

OAuth "connect account" pattern (`src/routes/api/connect/{google,devto,linkedin}`) plus
pluggable publishers (`src/lib/services/publishers/{devto,linkedin}.ts`) and scheduling
(`ScheduleManager.svelte`). Upstream the connect + publisher interfaces; ship dev.to /
LinkedIn as reference implementations.

### Cron endpoint pattern (from the payments/credits app)

`src/routes/api/cron/` convention wired to Cloudflare cron triggers in `wrangler.toml`,
with a shared auth guard. Document + scaffold in *Space.

## Upstream candidates — smaller components & utils

- **NewVersionBanner** (the payments/credits app's
  `src/lib/components/NewVersionBanner.svelte`) — "a new deploy is live, refresh"
  banner; pairs with Cloudflare's frequent deploys.
- **GoogleFontPicker** (Nabu `src/lib/components/GoogleFontPicker.svelte`) — theme-system
  companion.
- **ColorHarmonyWheel / BrandColorEditor** (Nabu) — color tooling for the theme system;
  wheel is generic, editor may stay brand-specific.
- **PricingSection** (Nabu `src/lib/components/PricingSection.svelte` + `utils/pricing.ts`) —
  standard marketing pricing block; pairs with the Stripe module.
- **Revision-history pattern** (Nabu `text-history.ts`, `media-history.ts`,
  `TextRevisionHistory.svelte`; the payments/credits app keeps versions too) — generic
  "field revisions with revert" service + UI.
- **Discord webhook notifications** (the payments/credits app's
  `src/lib/utils/discord.ts`) — tiny ops notifier for signups/purchases/errors.
- **display-name.ts** (the payments/credits app) — safe public display-name derivation.
- **oauth-state.ts** (the payments/credits app) — signed OAuth `state` handling; review
  against *Space's current auth flow and upstream the hardening.

## Backports — fixes made downstream to *Space files

- **account-merge: configurable table list** (Nabu `src/lib/services/account-merge.ts`) —
  downstream apps add tables keyed by `user_id`; Nabu introduced
  `USER_ID_TRANSFER_TABLES` (+ an admin-status check). *Space should make the transfer
  table list a documented extension point instead of a hardcoded set.
- **theme store: defensive localStorage access** (the payments/credits app's
  `src/lib/stores/theme.ts`) — guards for SSR/disabled-storage environments before
  touching `localStorage` / `matchMedia`.
- **cms XSS hardening** (the payments/credits app's `src/lib/cms/utils.ts`) —
  `escapeHtml` for rendered content; reconcile with *Space's newer
  `showInCommandPalette` normalization (changes went both directions).
- **Simulated-SSO "PRETEND" providers** (*Space `AuthProviderButtons.svelte`,
  `utils/session.ts`) — a near-stock deployment stripped this dev-only affordance.
  Decide: keep behind a dev flag or remove from *Space; it shouldn't require
  downstream deletion.

## Process note

Two downstream deployments remain near-stock, so template drift is manageable today.
When modules above land in *Space, sync them into those two first — they're effectively
free upgrades there, while Nabu and the payments/credits app will need per-file
reconciliation.
