# Initial Template Customization

> **Start with the ordered set path in [CUSTOMIZE.md](../CUSTOMIZE.md).** It runs the
> mechanical rename for you (`bun run customize`) and sequences the semantic steps.
> This file is the deep reference for the branding/asset details that path points to
> — especially the web-app icon set below.

**This repository's pass is already done** — see `INITIAL_CUSTOMIZATION_STATUS.md`, which reads `status: complete`. What follows is the reference for a fork.

Do it before feature work, bug fixes, or content entry. A fresh clone still contains NebulaKit branding and documentation; skip this step and the app, its metadata and its assistant guidance keep pointing back at the template.

## Goals

- Rename the app from NebulaKit to your actual product name.
- Replace the default social sharing and favicon assets.
- Replace NebulaKit-specific documentation content so users do not see template docs in your product — the `/documentation` route stays, its content becomes yours.
- Mark the work as complete in [INITIAL_CUSTOMIZATION_STATUS.md](../INITIAL_CUSTOMIZATION_STATUS.md).

## Required Checklist

- [ ] Replace visible app branding.
- [ ] Replace Open Graph, Twitter, and favicon assets.
- [ ] Generate the full web-app icon set (apple-touch-icon, manifest icons, light/dark favicons) — see below. A tab favicon alone is not enough; phone home-screen tiles need it.
- [ ] Rewrite the `/documentation` route and its links for your product (replace the content; keep the route).
- [ ] Confirm `site.slug` is your own slug, so this site's credential field names are unique — see below.
- [ ] Update [INITIAL_CUSTOMIZATION_STATUS.md](../INITIAL_CUSTOMIZATION_STATUS.md) to `status: complete`.

**Web-app icon set (required — a tab favicon alone is not enough).** Home-screen tiles and PWA installs ignore `<link rel="icon">`; they read `apple-touch-icon` and the web manifest. Without them, phones render a generated letter-monogram tile instead of the logo. From the site logo, generate and wire up:

- `static/apple-touch-icon.png` (180×180) — **solid background** (transparent → black on iOS); match `theme-color`.
- `static/icon-192.png`, `static/icon-512.png`, and `static/site.webmanifest` (`name`/`short_name`, `display: standalone`, `theme_color`/`background_color`).
- Light + dark tab favicons (`static/favicon-dark.png` / `static/favicon-light.png`) selected via `<link rel="icon" media="(prefers-color-scheme: …)">`, with a no-media default (default to dark).
- In `src/app.html`: `<link rel="apple-touch-icon">`, `<link rel="manifest">`, `<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-title">`.

Tiles and installed-app icons are static and cannot follow `prefers-color-scheme` — only the tab favicon switches. Reference implementation: davis9001.dev-sveltekit `src/app.html` + `static/`. See AGENTS.md §6.

### Credential Field Names Must Be Unique To This Site

Every auth and secret form on this template — login, signup, the profile password and
merge fields, `/setup`, and the admin AI-key and auth-key forms — builds its input
`id` and `name` from `site.slug` through
[src/lib/utils/form-fields.ts](../src/lib/utils/form-fields.ts). Two sites that both
ship `nebulakit-password` are read as the same login by any password manager that
matches on host rather than origin: two projects on `localhost`, or sibling subdomains
of one registrable domain. The wrong credentials get offered.

`bun run customize` fixes this as a side effect of setting the slug. If you renamed the
app by hand instead, check it yourself:

```bash
grep "slug:" src/lib/site.config.ts     # must be YOUR slug, not 'nebulakit'
bun run test tests/unit/auth-field-names.test.ts
```

That test also fails if a new form hardcodes `id="password"` instead of calling
`fieldName()`. When you add a form that collects a credential or a secret, use
`fieldName()` and add the route to `CREDENTIAL_ROUTES` in that test. Leave the
`autocomplete` tokens alone — `email`, `current-password`, and `new-password` are what
make autofill work correctly.

## Recommended Workflow

1. Pick the final product name, slug, dev port, and short tagline.
2. Run `bun run customize` (or `--dry` first). This rewrites [src/lib/site.config.ts](../src/lib/site.config.ts) and search-and-replaces the old name/slug/port/repo/URL across the UI, tests, docs, and `wrangler.toml`. See [CUSTOMIZE.md](../CUSTOMIZE.md).
3. Point `wrangler.toml` at your own Cloudflare resources (the script renames them but can't create them — see CUSTOMIZE.md Step 2).
4. Replace the social image and favicon assets with your own files (see the icon-set section above).
5. Rewrite the `/documentation` route for your app, and curate the command palette with `bun run palette:scan`. **Replace its content — do not delete the route.** From here on it must track every user-visible feature you add; see [DOCUMENTATION_PAGE.md](./DOCUMENTATION_PAGE.md) and AGENTS.md §7.
6. Confirm the credential field names are yours — `grep "slug:" src/lib/site.config.ts` must not say `nebulakit` (see the section above).
7. Update [INITIAL_CUSTOMIZATION_STATUS.md](../INITIAL_CUSTOMIZATION_STATUS.md) to `status: complete` when done.

## Definition Of Done

- No user-facing page still presents itself as NebulaKit unless that is your actual app name.
- Social shares use your own image, alt text, and metadata.
- Users cannot navigate to NebulaKit template documentation from the product UI.
- `/documentation` still exists, describes your app's real features, and is linked from the footer and command palette.
- Auth and secret form fields carry this site's own slug, not `nebulakit-*`.
- [INITIAL_CUSTOMIZATION_STATUS.md](../INITIAL_CUSTOMIZATION_STATUS.md) says `status: complete` and `credential_fields_unique: true`.
