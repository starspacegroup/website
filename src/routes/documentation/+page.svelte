			<h2>Site Content</h2>
			<p>
				The public directory is checked-in TypeScript, not CMS entries. It changes a few times a
				year, a pull request is a fine review step for "we shipped a thing", and the page has to
				render on a clone that has never been pointed at a database.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<code>src/lib/data/projects.ts</code> — the <a href="/projects">projects</a> grid.
					<code>featuredProjects</code> is the first three of the same list, so a new entry at the top
					leads the home page and the directory at once.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Card artwork lives under <code>static/projects/</code> as WebP, roughly 900px wide.
				<code>tests/unit/site-content.test.ts</code> fails when an entry names a file that is not there,
				so a renamed asset is caught before anyone sees a broken card.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Discord invite code lives once, in <code>src/lib/discord.ts</code>. The join buttons,
				the command palette entry and the member count all read it from there.

			<h2>What You Get Out of the Box</h2>
			<p>
				*Space integrates its main product surfaces as one Cloudflare-native application: identity,
				content management, AI workflows, administration, analytics, and agent-ready publishing.
			</p>
			<div class="callout-grid">
				<div class="callout-card">
					<h3>Core App Shell</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Keyboard-first navigation with command palette for fast route switching.</li>
						<li>Theme system with persistent light and dark preferences.</li>
						<li>Responsive layout, navigation, footer, and shared metadata components.</li>
						<li>
							A columned widget board with pointer, touch, and keyboard dragging — see
							<a href="#drag-and-drop">Drag and Drop</a>.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="callout-card">
					<h3>Account and Admin Flow</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Setup-first authentication flow for owner configuration.</li>
						<li>Login, signup, profile, reset, and admin routes all ship with the app.</li>
						<li>Cloudflare D1 and KV are used for setup state and application data.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="callout-card">
					<h3>Content and AI Surfaces</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Private CMS content types (<code>isPublic: false</code>) return <code>404</code> from
							public list/item routes and stay out of the sitemap; manage them under
							<code>/admin/cms</code>.
						</li>
						<li>
							Chat exposes only enabled entries from its known model allowlist. Unknown or disabled
							models are rejected rather than forwarded to a provider.
						</li>
						<li>
							Voice transcripts and replies persist in the same conversation history as text chat.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="callout-card">
					<h3>Contact Abuse Protection</h3>
					<p>
						Turnstile is optional only when both keys are absent. Set
						<code>TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY</code> and <code>TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY</code> together to enable it;
						partial configuration fails closed so the browser and server cannot disagree.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="callout-card">
					<h3>Live Voice on the Home Page</h3>
					<p>
						The hero shows who is really in the <code>#Ten Forward</code> voice channel when three
						or more people are in it, and a simulated channel otherwise. It shows
						<strong>avatars only</strong> — no display names, usernames or user ids ever reach the
						browser. It reads SpaceBot's <code>GET /api/v1/voice</code> from the server, through
						<code>/api/voice</code> here, so the key never reaches the browser either.
					</p>
					<p>
						Set <code>SPACEBOT_API_URL</code> and <code>SPACEBOT_API_KEY</code> (a SpaceBot key with
						the <code>voice:read</code> scope) to enable it, and
						<code>SPACEBOT_VOICE_CHANNEL</code> to watch a channel other than Ten Forward. Leave
						them unset and the hero simply keeps showing the simulation — as it does whenever
						SpaceBot is unreachable, or when fewer than three people are in the channel. Below that
						threshold the endpoint answers <code>{'{'}"live":false{'}'}</code> and no member data at all.
					</p>
					<p>
						The same key, carrying <code>stats:read</code> as well, draws the member-count trend
						under the hero's number: SpaceBot's <code>GET /api/v1/stats/members</code>, one point
						per day for 30 days, through <code>/api/members/history</code> here and cached for ten minutes.
						Aggregate totals only. Without the scope the count shows on its own.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="callout-card">
					<h3>Analytics and Operations</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							First-party, cookie-free analytics at <code>/admin/stats</code> — traffic, audience, and
							growth, with no third-party script.
						</li>
						<li>
							A Cloudflare plan-limit meter that projects whether today's traffic will exhaust your
							request allowance.
						</li>
						<li>Per-admin permission so operators can see stats without owner access.</li>
					</ul>

		<section id="how-to-use" class="docs-section">
			<h2>How To Use the App</h2>
			<p>
				Use the app in this order if you want the least confusing first run. That sequence matches
				how the repo is structured and avoids most setup-related false alarms.
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Open <code>/setup</code> first on a fresh environment and configure owner credentials.
				</li>
				<li>Complete <code>/setup</code> before expecting sign-in or AI features to work.</li>
				<li>
					Sign in through <code>/auth/login</code> or create an account through
					<code>/auth/signup</code>.
				</li>
				<li>Open the command palette with Ctrl/Cmd + K to move between major routes quickly.</li>
				<li>
					Use <code>/chat</code> for AI interactions, <code>/profile</code> for account settings,
					and <code>/admin</code> for operator tasks.
				</li>
				<li>Use the theme toggle to verify light, dark, and system-preference presentation.</li>
			</ol>
			<div class="callout-grid">
				<div class="callout-card">
					<h3>Common First-Run Checks</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>If auth looks broken, re-check setup lock state and provider credentials first.</li>
						<li>
							If chat is missing from navigation, verify AI provider configuration and route access.
						</li>
						<li>
							If admin tools are unavailable, confirm you are signed in as the configured owner.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="callout-card">
					<h3>Where To Extend</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Modify routes under <code>src/routes</code> when changing page behavior.</li>
						<li>Use <code>src/lib/components</code> for reusable UI and shell elements.</li>
						<li>
							Keep business logic in <code>src/lib/services</code> and shared helpers in
							<code>src/lib/utils</code>.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section id="drag-and-drop" class="docs-section">
			<h2>Drag and Drop</h2>
			<p>
				<code>&lt;WidgetBoard&gt;</code> takes a layout and a list of columns, and reports a new
				layout through <code>on:change</code>. It stores nothing itself, so where a layout is saved
				stays your decision.
			</p>
			<pre><code
					>{`<WidgetBoard bind:widgets {columns} on:change={(e) => save(e.detail.widgets)} />`}</code
				></pre>
			<p>
				Registering a widget takes three edits and none of them is the board: an entry in
				<code>src/lib/widgets/manifest.ts</code>, a line in
				<code>src/lib/widgets/index.ts</code>, and the component itself. The registry ships empty on
				purpose. The two actions underneath the board — <code>use:draggable</code> and
				<code>use:dropzone</code> — work on any markup, so a sortable list or a nav reorder needs no board
				at all.
			</p>
			<h3>Keyboard control</h3>
			<p>
				Every pointer gesture has a keyboard equivalent, announced through a live region. Focus a
				drag handle, then:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Space or Enter</strong> — pick the widget up, and put it down again.</li>
				<li><strong>Arrow up and down</strong> — move it within its column.</li>
				<li><strong>Arrow left and right</strong> — move it to the column either side.</li>
				<li><strong>Escape</strong> — cancel, returning it to where it started.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				On a touchscreen, hold a handle briefly before dragging — a swipe stays a swipe, so the page
				still scrolls. Dragging near the top or bottom edge scrolls the page with you.
			</p>
			<h3>The rule that will bite you</h3>
			<p>
				A widget's stored state must be inert. A value that changes on a timer — a price, a clock, a
				connection count — goes out through the widget's <code>live</code> event and comes back in
				through the board's <code>live</code> prop; it must never be written into
				<code>widget.title</code>, which is persisted. Ignoring this is how a dashboard rewrites its
				whole layout every thirty seconds and burns a day's storage quota from one open tab.
			</p>
			<p>
				Full reference, including the reorder contract and the component checklist:
				<code>docs/WIDGET_BOARD.md</code>.

		<section id="ai-workflow" class="docs-section">
			<h2>Working With AI in This Repo</h2>
			<p>
				Treat AI as a fast pair programmer, not as a source of truth. It is useful here because the
				repo already includes app structure, tests, and strong conventions, which gives the
				assistant real context to work against.
			</p>
			<div class="callout-grid">
				<div class="callout-card">
					<h3>Good Prompts</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Point the assistant at a concrete file, route, failing test, or command.</li>
						<li>Ask it to write or update tests first when changing behavior.</li>
						<li>
							Ask for narrow fixes instead of broad rewrites unless you want architectural change.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="callout-card">
					<h3>Good Validation Habits</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Have the assistant explain which route, store, or service controls the behavior.
						</li>
						<li>Require executable validation after changes, not only a diff summary.</li>
						<li>Always finish by running check, tests, and coverage.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="callout-card">
					<h3>What AI Is Best At Here</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Tracing a route from UI to service layer and identifying the smallest edit surface.
						</li>
						<li>Adding tests around setup, auth, chat, or command palette behavior.</li>
						<li>
							Summarizing repo conventions such as Cloudflare bindings, migrations, and theme rules.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>
				If you are using an AI coding agent, keep requests concrete: mention the page or failing
				test, state the desired behavior, and ask for the smallest validating change that solves it.

			<h2>Cloudflare Bindings</h2>
			<p>*Space is configured for Cloudflare Pages with these bindings in wrangler.toml:</p>

				<li><code>DB</code> as D1 database binding (database name: starspace-group-db).</li>

		<section id="database-migrations" class="docs-section">
			<h2>Database Migrations</h2>
			<p>
				Migrations are ordered SQL files under <code>migrations/</code> and tracked by D1. Never edit
				or delete existing migration files once committed to main.
			</p>
			<pre><code
					># Apply pending migrations to local D1
bun run db:migrate:local

# Apply pending migrations to remote D1
bun run db:migrate

				></pre>
			<p>
				When schema changes are needed, create a new file with the next sequence number (for
				example,
				<code>0012_add_feature_flag.sql</code>) and use ALTER TABLE or new CREATE statements.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section id="auth-and-setup" class="docs-section">
			<h2>Authentication and Setup Flow</h2>
			<p>
				Authentication is built into this app on a setup-first workflow — no third-party auth
				library sits in the request path. The browser receives an unsigned opaque session token
				(random, worthless without its server-side record — its SHA-256 digest is the lookup key),
				while the revocable session record, identity, and roles are loaded from D1 on every request.
				Authentication fails closed if D1 or <code>SESSION_SECRET</code> is unavailable.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can sign in with email and password, or with GitHub and Discord once those providers are
				configured. The main routes are <code>/setup</code>, <code>/auth/login</code>,
				<code>/auth/signup</code>, and <code>/reset</code>.
			</p>
			<div class="callout-grid">
				<div class="callout-card">
					<h3>1. Configure</h3>
					<p>
						Set <code>SESSION_SECRET</code> and <code>SETUP_SECRET</code>, then open
						<code>/setup</code>
						and submit the bootstrap secret, GitHub OAuth credentials, and admin GitHub username.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="callout-card">
					<h3>2. Lock Setup</h3>
					<p>
						After owner/config state exists, only the authenticated owner can change setup or manage
						authentication keys. GitHub and Discord validate unexpired one-time state in D1,
						exchange the provider code, then atomically consume that state before changing accounts
						or sessions. Discord does not bootstrap ownership; it inherits owner status only when
						linked or matched to the configured GitHub owner account.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="callout-card">
					<h3>3. Reset When Needed</h3>
					<p>
						<code>/reset</code> is owner-only. It clears setup-related KV keys, revokes every active D1
						session, and clears the browser cookie. The reset route can also be disabled.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section id="admin-analytics" class="docs-section">
			<h2>Admin Analytics</h2>
			<p>
				<code>/admin/stats</code> is the built-in analytics surface: traffic over a 1, 7, 30, or 90-day
				window, views by route, the most-read CMS items, referrers, countries, an audience breakdown,
				and user and content growth over time. It is first-party — there is no third-party script, no
				account, and no API key to provision.
			</p>
			<p>
				Everything collected is a daily aggregate counter in D1. There are
				<strong>no cookies, no identifiers, and no IP addresses</strong> anywhere in the feature. The
				User-Agent is read to classify the request and then discarded, so only coarse buckets (operating
				system, browser, device, language, viewport) are ever stored, and country comes from the Cloudflare
				edge rather than from an IP lookup. Because nothing per-visitor is retained, this needs no consent
				banner.
			</p>
			<div class="callout-grid">
				<div class="callout-card">
					<h3>Turning It On</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>
							Apply migrations <code>0007</code> through <code>0009</code>, plus
							<code>0014</code> for the Top content table, with
							<code>db:migrate:local</code> (or <code>db:migrate</code> for remote).
						</li>
						<li>
							Collection starts on the next request. Traffic and audience panels fill in as visits
							arrive.
						</li>
						<li>
							Country stays <code>(unknown)</code> in local development — it is supplied by the Cloudflare
							edge.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Top content</strong> appears once a published CMS item is read. It is the only counter
							whose row count grows with your catalogue rather than with a fixed list, so on a large catalogue
							watch it — the retention cron is what keeps it in hand.
						</li>
					</ol>
				</div>
				<div class="callout-card">
					<h3>Granting Access</h3>
					<p>
						The owner always sees Stats. Any other admin needs the <code>can_view_stats</code> flag, which
						defaults to off so existing admins do not gain access on upgrade:
					</p>
					<pre><code>UPDATE users SET can_view_stats = 1 WHERE email = 'someone@example.com';</code
						></pre>
					<p>
						The permission is re-read from the database on every request, so revoking it takes
						effect without waiting for a sign-out.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="callout-card">
					<h3>Retention</h3>
					<p>
						The counter tables grow one row per day per dimension unless pruned. Set
						<code>CRON_SECRET</code> and have any scheduler POST to the retention endpoint; rows older
						than 400 days are removed.
					</p>
					<pre><code
							>curl -X POST https://your-app/api/cron/prune-view-stats \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET"</code
						></pre>
				</div>
				<div class="callout-card">
					<h3>Platform Usage Meter</h3>
					<p>
						The same page tracks <em>billable</em> Function invocations — a larger set than page
						views, since bots, <code>/api/*</code> calls, 404s, and non-GET requests all count against
						your plan. It projects whether today will exhaust the free 100,000-request daily allowance
						before the UTC reset.
					</p>
					<p>
						Treat it as an early warning and a floor, not a bill: the Cloudflare dashboard remains
						authoritative.

			<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					If setup API reports KV unavailable, create KV namespaces and update wrangler.toml binding
					IDs.
				</li>
				<li>
					If login fails after setup, confirm OAuth callback URL and ensure GitHub credentials are
					valid.
				</li>
				<li>
					If migrations fail, run <code>bun run db:migrate:list</code> and check migration numbering.
				</li>
				<li>
					If command palette entries are missing, verify AI provider status and authentication
					state.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Agent Readiness</h2>
			<p>
				This site publishes a machine-readable discovery layer so search crawlers and AI agents can
				find it, read it efficiently, and understand how to interact with it. Everything below is
				live without per-domain URL configuration. Placeholder Cloudflare bindings still make
				<code>/api/health</code> return <code>503</code> until project-owned D1/KV resources are configured.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<a href="/robots.txt">/robots.txt</a> — crawl rules, explicit entries for AI crawlers (GPTBot,
					ClaudeBot, PerplexityBot and others), and Content Signals declaring how the content may be used.
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="/sitemap.xml">/sitemap.xml</a> — every public page plus all published CMS content,
					regenerated on request so newly published items appear immediately.
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="/.well-known/api-catalog">/.well-known/api-catalog</a> — an RFC 9727 catalog of this
					deployment's APIs.
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="/.well-known/agent-skills/index.json">/.well-known/agent-skills/index.json</a>
					— short guides teaching an agent how to read content and contact the site, each with a SHA-256
					digest.
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="/auth.md">/auth.md</a> — how agents authenticate (and what is not offered).
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="/api/health">/api/health</a> — service health, used as the catalog's status link.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The catalog currently anchors these implemented endpoints:
				<code>/api/contact-form-submissions</code>, <code>/api/health</code>,
				<code>/api/cms/types</code>, <code>/api/chat/models</code>, and
				<code>/api/chat/stream</code>. Their catalog notes distinguish public, Turnstile-gated, and
				session-authenticated access.
			</p>

			<h3>Reading pages as Markdown</h3>
			<p>
				Any page can be fetched as Markdown instead of HTML by sending an
				<code>Accept: text/markdown</code> header. Browsers are unaffected — HTML remains the
				default. Responses include an <code>x-markdown-tokens</code> estimate so an agent can budget context
				before reading.
			</p>
			<pre><code>curl -H 'Accept: text/markdown' {site.url}/</code></pre>

			<h3>In-browser tools (WebMCP)</h3>
			<p>
				When opened by a WebMCP-capable agent, this site registers tools for searching content,
				listing pages, reading a page as Markdown, navigating, and switching theme. They are
				read-and-navigate only and restricted to this site's own origin. The page-reading tool
				enforces the public sitemap allowlist with browser credentials omitted, so an authenticated
				visitor cannot expose private/admin pages through WebMCP.
			</p>

			<h3>Content usage policy</h3>
			<p>
				The shipped default is fully permissive — <code>search=yes, ai-input=yes, ai-train=yes</code
				>
				— which matches *Space's public open-source content. Change
				<code>CONTENT_SIGNAL</code> in <code>src/lib/agent-discovery.ts</code> before publishing any proprietary
				content; every robots.txt group picks the change up automatically.
			</p>
			<p>
				DNS-based discovery (DNS-AID) is the one piece that must be added by hand, since DNS records
				live with your provider rather than in this repo. See
				<code>docs/AGENT_READINESS.md</code> for the exact records and the DNSSEC requirement.
			</p>
