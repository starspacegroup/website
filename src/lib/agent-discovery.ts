/**
 * Agent discovery surface — the single source of truth for the machine-readable
 * contract this site publishes to AI agents, LLM crawlers, and search engines.
 *
 * Consumed by:
 *   - src/routes/robots.txt/+server.ts          (crawl rules + content signals)
 *   - src/routes/sitemap.xml/+server.ts         (canonical URL index)
 *   - src/routes/.well-known/api-catalog/+server.ts
 *   - src/routes/.well-known/agent-skills/...   (skills discovery index)
 *   - src/hooks.server.ts                       (RFC 8288 Link headers)
 *   - tests/unit/agent-readiness.test.ts        (regression guard)
 *
 * WHY THIS IS ONE MODULE: the guard test asserts that every public page route
 * is either listed for the sitemap or explicitly excluded *with a stated
 * reason*. Adding a page without deciding its crawl policy fails the test suite
 * rather than silently shipping an incomplete sitemap. See AGENTS.md §8.
 *
 * WHY REQUEST-ORIGIN URLS, NOT `site.config.url`: the sitemap protocol requires
 * every listed URL to share the sitemap's own host, and robots.txt is per-host
 * by definition. Deriving from the live request keeps preview deploys, custom
 * domains, and *.pages.dev all correct without deploy-specific URL edits.
 *
 * This module must stay dependency-free (no `$app`, no Node APIs) so routes,
 * hooks, and tests can all import it.
