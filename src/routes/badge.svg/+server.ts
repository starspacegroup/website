/**
 * GET /badge.svg — the badge as an image, for READMEs and anywhere else an
 * `<img>` is the only thing that fits.
 *
 * `?variant=building|built|member` and `?theme=dark|light` pick the wording and
 * the ground. Both are read through the type guards in `$lib/badge` and fall
 * back to the defaults, so an unknown value renders the default badge rather
 * than a 400 — a broken image in someone else's README tells them nothing, and
 * the query string is usually copied by hand.
 *
 * Nothing from the request reaches the document. The two parameters are matched
 * against fixed key sets before use, so there is no path by which a crafted URL
 * can put markup or script into an SVG this origin serves.
 *
 * The body is self-contained: the mark travels as a data URI and the colours
 * are literals, because an SVG used as an `<img>` may not fetch anything.
